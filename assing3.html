		<p>India aimed "to convert India's economy into that of a modern state and to fit her into the nuclear age and do it quickly."
		It was understood that India had not been at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution, and hence made an effort to promote higher education, and science and technology in India.</p>
	<h2 class="c1">Planning in 1950</h2>
		<p id="id1">Planning Commission (1950) fixed investment levels, prescribed priorities, divided funds between agriculture and industry, and divided resources between the state and the federal governments.</p>
	<h3>Space Eploration</h3>	
		<p>The result of the efforts between 1947â€“1962 saw the area under irrigation increase by 45 million acres (180,000 km2), food production rise by 34 million metric tons, installed power generating capacity increase by 79 million kilowatts, and an overall increase of 94 percent in industrial production.</p>
