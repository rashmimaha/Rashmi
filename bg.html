	<h1>CSS</h1>
	<P style="color:pink">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</P>
	<h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
	<p>	This module starts with the basics of how CSS works, including selectors and properties, writing CSS rules, applying CSS to HTML, how to specify length, color, and other units in CSS, cascade and inheritance, box model basics, and debugging CSS.</p>
	<h2>Styling text</h2>
	<p>This module discusses text styling fundamentals, including setting fonts, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, text drop shadows, and other text properties. This module finishes with applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links</p>
	<h2>Styling boxes</h2>
	<p>This module looks at styling boxes, one of the fundamental steps towards laying out a web page. In this module we recap the box model, then look at controlling box layouts by setting margins, borders, and padding, custom background colors, images and other features, and fancy features such as drop shadows and filters on boxes.</p>
    <h2>CSS layout</h2>
    <p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so you can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, traditional layout methods involving float and positioning, and newfangled layout tools like flexbox.</p>
